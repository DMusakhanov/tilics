Studying Computer Science is like taking a deep dive into an endless ocean of ideas, concepts, and tools. It is a vast ecosystem where everything is interconnected, where exploring one thing opens doors to a plethora of other, equally interesting, things. It is easy to get lost in this wide landscape, even more so if it is not one's main field of expertise. 

This is why Computer Science students of the University of Basel set out to identify the essential concepts and ideas they discovered during their studies. The intention was to go beyond the scope of traditional textbooks and also include the pecularities that are not formally part of a usual Computer Science curriculum. Finally, the goal was to present the fruit of this work to people outside of our field. 

The project was organized in the form of a Master's level seminar, which had its first iteration during the spring semester 2019. The result is *Things I Learned in Computer Science*, a collection of short illustrated articles. It is available in the form of this small booklet, and online on the companion website [1].

Due to the success and the positive feedback, the work will continue in the next edition of the seminar.
