Studying Computer Science is like taking a deep dive into an endless ocean of ideas, concepts, and tools. It is a vast ecosystem where everything is interconnected, where exploring one thing opens  doors to a plethora of other, equally interesting, things. Software engineering, information theory, computer networks, machine learning, and artificial  intelligence, are only a few of the subcategories that together form the  discipline of computer science.

It is easy to get lost in this wide landscape, even more so if it is not one's main field of expertise. This is why Computer Science students of the University of Basel set out to identify the essential concepts and ideas they learned during  their studies and make them accessible to people outside of our field. 

The result is *Things I Learned in Computer Science*, a small booklet with 2^5 illustrated articles about what we consider to be the essential lessons we learned while exploring this science.
