\mytopic{Sometimes a problem can be solved \\
by solving the same problem, but smaller}

Imagine a problem that you can only solve if you know the solution to
smaller instances of the same problem. Computing, for example, the
10th element from the famous \emph{Fibonacci sequence}, will require
you to sum up the 9th and 8th Fibonacci number. But if you don't know
the 10th number, you will most certainly not know the 9th and 8th
either. So you`ll have to go deeper: In order to obtain the 9th
number, you need to add the 8th and 7th element. Knowing the 8th will
require the 7th and 6th. And so on. Doing this is
called \emph{Recursion}.

But when to stop? Recursion only works if there are certain smallest
problems for which you \emph{know} the solution, otherwise you'll keep
fragmenting forever. Continuing with the approach above will
eventually lead you to computing the 1st and 2nd Fibonacci number,
which are defined to be 0 and 1, respectively. Knowing these will
allow you to hand the results all the way to the top and finally
obtain the desired 10th Fibonacci number.
