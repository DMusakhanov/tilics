\mytopic{We all hate Bugs}

Bugs creep into your house without notice, there they eat your food
and clog your sink.  They hide in corners and behind large furniture
and are most of the times hard to find. If you find a bug that was
bothering you for a long time the feeling of success is rewarding.

A bug in software is very simmilar. It's usually a behavior of the
software which is not intended. It is often very hard to find bugs in
software and can sometimes be attributed to one single character that
was wrongly placed.

The act of finding bugs is called Debugging. Like pest control, the
code is searched and cleaned from every bug that influences the
behavior negatively.  Unfortunately, while fixing software bugs the
programmer accidentally adds other bugs. The cicle is endless.
