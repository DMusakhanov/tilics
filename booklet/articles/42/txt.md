Random variables quantify the outcomes of a random process which could have different outputs. They are different from Algebra variables that have only a single value. In our daily life, there are many examples of such random processes, such as stock market, blood pressure, or even simpler such as flipping a coin or rolling a dice. 

To be able to do some mathematics on these outcomes, we need to define a value for each of these outcomes. For instance, according to our example, we could check the probability of X is head by calculating P(X=1). In probability theory, many methods use random variables.
