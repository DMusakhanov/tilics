\mytopic{Zero is not null }

The {\tt null} value has a special meaning in computer science. It is used
to declare that a value is not yet defined or known.

The speciality of {\tt null} is that although it shows us that a value
is missing, it is itself a value. So it is possible to compare two non
existing values. Suppose we have data about a patient; it does make a
different if the patient has no disease ({\tt 0}) or is not yet
diagnosed ({\tt null}).
