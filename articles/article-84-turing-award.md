# Why no Nobel prize for computer scienctists?
<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Because, Alfred Nobel wasn't interested in Mathematics, and computer science is a part of the Mathematics field. He was interested only in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, and Peace.

Luckily, there are other prizes that are equivalent to the Nobel prize for computer scientists and are provided annually as well. Such as Turing Award that is given by The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), John von Neumann Medal that is provided by IEEE, and John von Neumann Theory Prize that is given by the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS).
