# Why is there no Nobel prize for computer scientists?
<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Some say it was because Alfred Nobel's fiancé had an affair with a mathematician, which can be considered the foundation of computer science, while others believe Nobel was just more interested in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace than in mathematics.

Luckily, there is a "Nobel Prize of Computing" which is the A.M. Turing Award. It is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery to an individual who makes significant contributions to the computer field. The award is named after Alan Mathison Turing, who was a mathematician and computer scientist. In 1966, Alan J. Perlis received the first Turing award for his achievements in advanced computer programming techniques and compiler construction. Most recently, in 2018, Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hintonor, and Yann LeCun received the award for improving deep neural networks.
