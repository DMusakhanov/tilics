# “Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration.”

An array is a data structure to store some elements with an index for each. 
This coins the question: 'what is the smallest index?'

Most programming languages start an array at index 0 because it is the smallest natural number that can be represented in a binary system. But there are some rare outliers that start with index 1. 

If you want to figure out whether the person in front of you is a computer scientist or not, there is one easy way to find it out: 
Show a bunch of things an let they count them. The true computer scientist will start to count with a zero.
