# Machines within Machines: Compilers
<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
In 1954, computers just computed numbers. Grace Hopper, a famous
female programmer around then, had a hard time to convince her
colleagues that these machines can do more.

The picture is hers and shows how a computer program can translate
one computer program into another one. She even coined the term that is still use
today: a **compiler**.

Nowadays we have many more of these translation and transformation
machines, with names as funny as the picture: _cross-compilers_,
_transpilers_ and _compiler-compilers_ (cocos). Their mission is to
translate from one computer language to another, for example a C
program to machine code. But they can also be used to "transpile"
from a new version of a programming to the old one, like e.g.,
JavaScript6 to JavaScript5.
