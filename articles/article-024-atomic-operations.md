# Atomic Operations

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Imagine a railway intersection, there is only ever enough space to pass for one train at a time. If another train tries to pass the intersection while its already in use, a crash happens.

The same thing can happen in a computer, where we might think that everything happens sequentially. But in a world where most computers have multiple processors, each working on their own, things can go wrong as soon as two of them want to access the same file.

Similar to a light signal for the railway intersection which only allows one train to pass at a time, computers have something called *Atomic Operations*. These are either done in their entirety or not done at all.
