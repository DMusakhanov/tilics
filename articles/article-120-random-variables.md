Random variables quantify the outcomes of a random process which could have different outputs. 
They are different from algebraic variables that only have a single value. 
In our daily life, there are many examples of such random processes, such as the stock market, 
blood pressure, or even simpler things such as flipping a coin or rolling a dice. 

To be able to do some mathematics on these outcomes, we need to define a value for each respective one. 
For instance, according to our example, we could check the probability of X being head by calculating P(X=1). 
In probability theory, many methods use random variables.
