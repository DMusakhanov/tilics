Random variables quantify the outcomes of a random process, and they are different from Algebra variables as they could have different values. But, what is a random process? A random process is a process that could have different outputs, such as flipping a coin or rolling a dice. 

To be able to do some mathematics on these outcomes, we need to define a value for each of these outcomes. For instance, according to our example, we could check the probability of X is head by calculating P(X=1). In probability theory, many methods use random variables.
