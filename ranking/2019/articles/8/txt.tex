\mytopic{The more FLOPS the better}

FLOPS is a performance measurement indicating how many \textbf{fl}oating point \textbf{op}erations can be calculated in a \textbf{s}econd. It is used to measure the performance of computers and their processors. A floating point operation describes a mathematical procedure using decimal numbers. Despite the human brain being immensely powerful its capabilities when doing decimal calculations is limited. It is estimated at around 0.01 FLOPS, roughly 1 calculation every 100 seconds. In comparison, a modern smartphone has about 10$^{12}$ FLOPS (1 Teraflop), while the fastest super computer has around 100$\times$10$^{15}$ FLOPS (100 Petaflops). Historically, the power of processors has been increasing exponentially (according to Moore's Law).
