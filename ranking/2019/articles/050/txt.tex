\mytopic{The first words of a computer scientist}

The first piece of code you usually find in a programming book or tutorial is a ``Hello World!'' program. The purpose of this program is to display the text ``Hello World!''. Because this is rather simple for nearly all programming languages, it is a good example to see the basic flavor of a programming language. Due to this tradition, these are usually the first lines of code a programmer writes in their live.
