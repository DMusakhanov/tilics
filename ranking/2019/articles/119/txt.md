# How to find a solution through learning
<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
If we try to solve a problem, we always appreciated if we get feedback on how good we where and this is the same case for a program.
In supervised learning we first let a program solve  problems,
where we do now the results, like for example finding the labels of different points, so called classification. 
Through this training we know how good the solutions of the program are and can adjust the program for efficiency,
and can then use it for the same kind of problem where we do not know the solution.
