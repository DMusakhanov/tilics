\mytopic{``Brute Force'' means you are weak}

For some problems in Computer Science, it can be proven that there are
no ``efficient'' ways of solving them. In this case, the only resort is
\textbf{brute force}. Brute force means that you let the computer try out
every possible --and we really mean \emph{every} single, possible and
potential-- value that solves the problem, until you succeed.

Several cryptographic algorithms are based on such problems where the
secret key can only be guessed or found by
exhaustively trying out all possible values, which could take a few
billion years. Confronted with
such time scales, attackers find themselves in a very weak position.
