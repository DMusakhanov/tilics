\mytopic{Errors propagate!}

In daily life it is common to neglect small inaccuracies, be it rounding up change or not being exactly on time.

However, the world of computing is less forgiving.
Due to the representation of (floating-point) numbers, there nearly always is a little bit of inaccuracy present and careless computations can increase it substantially.
Depending on the problem the errors can increase explosively for each step of an algorithm
leading to unfortunate results.
