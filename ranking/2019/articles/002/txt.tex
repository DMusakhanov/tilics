\mytopic{CamelCase, or why coding conventions matter}

One problem that often arises when writing code is the naming of
variables. Often multi-word names are used for variables, but in most
programming languages it is not possible to use spaces in a variable
name.

One programming style that tries to structure this is called
CamelCase. It is the practice of writing each word in the middle of a
phrase with a capital letter:
