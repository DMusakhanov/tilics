\mytopic{Introductions are universal}

When people meet each other for the first time, there is usually some sort of formal introduction. This fundamental process also applies to computer science and is called a handshake. During a handshake, different processes agree to communicate with each other based on a set of rules, known as a protocol. Sometimes the protocol involves identifying each other using private keys or passwords.
