\mytopic{We have Machines within Machines}

In 1954, computers just computed numbers. Grace Hopper, a famous
female programmer around then, had a hard time to convince her
colleagues that these machines can do more.

The picture is hers and shows how a computer program can translate
one computer program into another one. She even coined the term that is still in use
today: a \textbf{compiler}.

Nowadays, we have many more of these translation and transformation
machines, with names as funny as the picture: \emph{cross-compilers},
\emph{transpilers}, and \emph{compiler-compilers} (cocos). Their mission is to
translate from one computer language to another, for example
to ``compile'' a human-written program to machine code, or to
``transpile'' from a new version of a programming language to the old one.
