\mytopic{Why are you hiding this?}

The idea for information hiding is to reduce complexity and to interact not with the information/data directly,
but only indirectly via an interface. But why would we do this?

Suppose we want to get a drink from a vending machine,
we need to select only, which drink we want and then pay for this, we never see the real work and the logic behind the vending machine.

This is the same for computer program: We use interfaces to hide information/methods. This also means that we can interchange the hidden information easily as long as we do not change the interface. Furthermore, if we cannot see into the program or the machine, we will have a harder time to manipulate it, as we do not know how exactly it works.
