\mytopic{Why stick to one example}

Using the same example, again and again, seems to be quite boring without any added benefit.
In some instances, however, this can be used for some positive effect. Using a known example to show different things (like methods or algorithms) saves time, as the people don't have to think about the example used in much detail.
In this book, the common example is the Fibonacci Sequence which starts with 0 and 1. Every next number is the sum of their two predecessors.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,\ldots{}

The well-known picture according to this Sequence is the Fibonacci spiral.
